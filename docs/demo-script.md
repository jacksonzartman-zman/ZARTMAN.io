# 2-minute demo script (talk track) — for Anthony

## Goal
Show the end-to-end quoting workflow with **clear handoffs**, **fast CAD previews**, and **confident supplier selection**—the parts that matter operationally and commercially.

## Talk track (≈2 minutes)
**0:00–0:15 | Set the scene**
- “Anthony, this is the workflow from *intake → review → supplier selection → award*.”
- “The north star is clarity: what’s happening, what’s next, and who owns the next step.”

**0:15–0:45 | Intake → instant understanding (CAD preview)**
- “Here’s a new request with uploaded CAD. The key is we don’t get stuck downloading files or guessing what’s inside.”
- “We generate a **CAD preview** so you can sanity-check geometry immediately—right in the workflow.”
- “That means fewer back-and-forths, faster qualification, and fewer surprises before we engage suppliers.”

**0:45–1:25 | Supplier selection → make the best choice, quickly**
- “Next is supplier selection. This is where operators win or lose time.”
- “We keep supplier responses and context organized, so it’s easy to compare options and make a decision confidently.”
- “When we award, it’s a clear moment in the workflow: everyone can see the chosen supplier and the next steps—no ambiguity, no hidden state.”

**1:25–1:50 | Workflow clarity (status + accountability)**
- “Throughout, the system is opinionated about *what’s pending* and *who needs to act*.”
- “That’s the operational value: fewer dropped balls, less Slack archaeology, and a consistent process you can scale.”

**1:50–2:00 | Close**
- “So the story is: **quick understanding via CAD preview**, **structured supplier selection**, and **clear workflow state** from start to award.”
- “Payments and checkout are planned next—we’re focused today on making the core workflow rock-solid.”

## What we’ll build next
- **Checkout basics** (simple, reliable order placement flow)
- **PO upload** (attach and track customer POs in the workflow)
- **Payment methods** (support key methods; implementation details planned)
- **Revision requests** (structured change requests with clear history)
- **Notifications** (timely updates for customers, suppliers, and internal operators)
